# NFT

NFT stands for non-fungible token which can be used in the marketplace in the unit currency for cyptro.

Here I have used two models and modified it into my requirements , basically in the addition to the code you need to add content and style image that you will want to apply on your content images rest code will generate the resulting image in your folder.

This is one of the model workflow , in addition to second model i have used very common method called image merging or image blending.

In this you will merge two image into one image but i have tested it on very complex images and results were not so satisfactory so i have followed the first model approch to generate NFTs.

You can connect with me for better understanding , gneration and collaboration with NFTs.
